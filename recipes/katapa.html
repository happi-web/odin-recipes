    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of pounded katapa cassava leaves</li>
        <li>2-3 tablespoons of groundnuts powder</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 tomato, chopped</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by thoroughly washing the fresh katapa cassava leaves.</li>
        <li>Pound or grind the leaves using a mortar and pestle called “Kabende and Kamunsi” until they are finely broken down. 
        Be careful not to grind them too finely. </li>
        <li>Alternatively, you can use a blender, but ensure that the leaves do not become overly fine.</li>
        <li>Place the pounded katapa cassava leaves into a pot and add water just above the level of the leaves. Start boiling.</li>
        <li>Boil the leaves for about 2-3 hours or until they become tender, making sure to add more water if needed.</li>
        <li>Once the leaves are tender, add the chopped tomatoes, onions, groundnuts powder, and salt to the pot. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Allow the dish to simmer for about 40 minutes on medium heat, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking and ensure even cooking.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.</li>
        <li>Serve the Katapa with nshima and a protein dish such as dry fish stew.</li>
    </ol>
