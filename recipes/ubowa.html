        There are many types of mushrooms common in Zambia during the rainy season. 
        All the different varieties are very tasty. 
        Today we are going to cook the red brown mushroom recipe. 
        These are small in size and red and orange-ish in color.

        They have a nice soft texture and a great aroma.
        I also mixed them up with other small mushrooms which are brown in color for a more colorful dishand to make them even more tasty and delicious. 
        This  red brown mushroom recipe is a Zambian way of cooking.
