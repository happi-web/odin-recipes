CONCEPTS IMPLEMENTED

This project is currently coded completely in HTML. From what I learnt on the Odin Project, I practiced:

Working with a standard HTML boilerplate.
Using anchor tags <a></a> complete with attributes such as href.
Using ordered and unordered lists (<ol></ol> & <ul></ul>) and <li></li> list item tags.
Using image tags <img> with src, alt and width attributes.
Working with relative links.
Using various heading tags e.g <h1> and <h2> as well as paragraph tags <p>.
Working with the terminal.
Using Git and GitHub for version history management for my project.
And more beginner level coding skills here and there.
