# Recipe Website

This is a basic recipe website created as part of the Odin Project's Foundations Course.

## Features

The website currently contains:

- An extremely simple homepage: `index.html`
- A page for Ifisashi Zambian Food recipe: `ifisashi.html`
- A page for Ubowa recipe: `ubowa.html`
- A page for Katapa (cassava leaves with groundnuts) recipe: `katapa.html`

## Concepts Implemented

This project is entirely coded in HTML. Here are the key concepts I practiced while building it:

- Setting up a standard HTML boilerplate.
- Working with anchor tags (`<a>`) complete with attributes such as `href`.
- Using ordered (`<ol>`) and unordered (`<ul>`) lists and list item tags (`<li>`).
- Embedding images using `<img>` tags with `src`, `alt`, and `width` attributes.
- Implementing relative links.
- Utilizing various heading tags (e.g., `<h1>`, `<h2>`) and paragraph tags (`<p>`).
- Navigating and working with the terminal.
- Using Git and GitHub for version control and managing project history.
- Applying beginner-level coding skills to create a functional project.

## Future Improvements

- Implementing CSS for better styling and design.
- Adding more recipes to expand the website's content.
- Improving navigation with a better menu or layout.
